# Battery-Charging-And-Over-Charge-Protection-Circuit
A simple and cost-effective battery overcharge protection circuit using a transistor-relay system. Simulates automatic disconnection after a safe voltage threshold in Proteus.

## Features
- Automatic cut-off on overvoltage
- LED indicator for charging status
- Simulated in Proteus
- Uses common components (BC547, relay, 7809, etc.)

## Included Files
- Simulation file (.dsn)
- Project report (.pdf / .docx)
